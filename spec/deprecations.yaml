# This file specifies the status of all of Sass's deprecations in a
# machine-readable way. After updating this file, run
# `npm run sync-deprecations` to update the JS API spec and docs in this repo.
#
# The Dart Sass compiler and the Node embedded host use this file to generate
# their lists of deprecations. Other embedded hosts should do the same if they
# expose the list of deprecations in their APIs.
