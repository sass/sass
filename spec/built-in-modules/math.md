# Math Module

This built-in module is available from the URL `sass:math`.

This module contains Sassified versions of all the mathematical constants and
functions in the [CSS Values and Units 4 Draft], and more (such as logarithms,
`e`, `pi`). Each function is basically equivalent to its mathematical form,
though some have special handling of units.

## Functions

### Bounding Functions

#### `ceil()`

```
ceil($number)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `ceil()`.

#### `clamp()`

```
clamp($min, $number, $max)
```

* If some arguments have units and some do not, throw an error.
* If `$min`, `$number`, and `$max` have units, but the units are not
  [compatible] with each other, throw an error.
* If `$min >= $max`, return `$min`.
* If `$number <= $min`, return `$min`.
* If `$number >= $max`, return `$max`.

[compatible]: ../types/number.md#compatible-units

#### `floor()`

```
floor($number)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `floor()`.

```
max($numbers...)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `max()`.

#### `min()`

```
min($numbers...)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `min()`.

#### `round()`

```
round($number)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `round()`.

### Distance Functions

#### `abs()`

```
abs($number)
```

This function is also available as a global function named `abs()`.

#### `hypot()`

```
hypot($numbers...)
```

* If some numbers have units and some do not, throw an error.
* If all numbers have units, but the units are not [compatible] with each other,
  throw an error.

* If any number equals `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, return `Infinity`.
* Return the square root of the sum of the squares of each number.

### Exponential Functions

> Exponential operations on numbers with units would create meaningless units
> (e.g. `(1px)^(1/3)` has a unit of `px^(1/3)`). To prevent this, the
> exponential functions accept only a unitless number as input, and return a
> unitless number.

### Trigonometric Functions

> The trigonometric functions accept a number with a unit, as long as that unit
> is an [angle] type, and output a unitless number. If the input is unitless, it
> must be treated as though it were in `rad`.
>
> The inverse trig functions accept unitless numbers and output a number in
> `deg`.

#### `atan2()`

> `atan2($y, $x)` is distinct from `atan($y / $x)` because it preserves the
> quadrant of the point in question. For example, `atan2(1, -1)` corresponds to
> the point `(-1, 1)` and returns `135deg`. In contrast, `atan(1 / -1)` and
> `atan(-1 / 1)` resolve first to `atan(-1)`, so both return `-45deg`.

```
atan2($y, $x)
```

* If the units of `$y` and `$x` are not [compatible], throw an error.
* If `$y` has units and `$x` does not, or vice-versa, throw an error.
* If the inputs match one of the following edge cases, return the provided
  number. Otherwise, return the [2-argument arctangent] of `$y` and `$x`, as a
  number in `deg`.
