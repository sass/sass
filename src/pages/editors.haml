  Various text editors have various levels of support for Haml.
  Here's a list of all of them that I know of.
  If you create or learn of another or a more updated version,
  please email [haml@googlegroups.com](mailto:haml@googlegroups.com).

  Haml gets new syntax every now and then.
  This means that most of these modes are at least a little out-of-date.
  If anyone wants to take on the task of updating an old mode,
  that would be greatly appreciated.

  * **[Eclipse](http://haml.googlegroups.com/web/net.lucky_dip.hamleditor_site_0.5.4.zip)**
    by [Brad Wilson](http://lucky-dip.net/).
    This is a snapshot of the site that used to host the plugin,
    so it may be a bit confusing to get it working.

  * **[Emacs](http://github.com/nex3/haml/tree/master/extra/haml-mode.el)**
    by [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com).
    Probably the most up-to-date mode,
    since it's maintained by the Haml maintainer.

  * **[GEdit/Gnome](http://blog.ardekantur.com/2008/03/haml-syntax-highlighting-for-gedit/)**
    by [Ardenkatur](http://ardekantur.com/).
    There's also an [older package](http://groups.google.com/group/haml/msg/b5100d80d9182c71)
    by [Ivan Kerin](http://www.facebook.com/ivan.kn).

  * **[JEdit](http://haml.googlegroups.com/web/haml.xml?hl=en)**
    by [Jim Morris](http://blog.wolfman.com/).
    May not work with recent versions of JEdit.

  * **[TextMate/E Text Editor](http://github.com/handcrafted/handcrafted-haml-textmate-bundle)**
    by [Adam Stacoviak](http://www.adamstacoviak.com).
    There's also an [official](http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle)
    but out-of-date bundle by [Kevin Ballard](http://kevin.sb.org),
    and many [GitHub forks](http://github.com/douglasjarquin/ruby-haml-tmbundle/network)
    of that bundle.

  * **[Vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-haml)**

    but out-of-date mode by [Dmitry Ilyashevich](http://github.com/dmitry-ilyashevich).
