  Various text editors have various levels of support for Sass.
  Here's a list of all of them that I know of.
  If you create or learn of another or a more updated version,
  please email [haml@googlegroups.com](mailto:haml@googlegroups.com).

  Sass gets new syntax every now and then.
  This means that most of these modes are at least a little out-of-date.
  If anyone wants to take on the task of updating an old mode,
  that would be greatly appreciated.

  * **[Eclipse](http://haml.googlegroups.com/web/net.lucky_dip.hamleditor_site_0.5.4.zip)**
    by [Brad Wilson](http://lucky-dip.net/).
    This is a snapshot of the site that used to host the plugin,
    so it may be a bit confusing to get it working.

  * **[Emacs](http://github.com/nex3/haml/tree/master/extra/sass-mode.el)**
    by [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com).
    Probably the most up-to-date mode,
    since it's maintained by the Sass maintainer.
