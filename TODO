  [2.4] Syntax highlighting?

* Code
** Haml
   Interpolation shouldn't make non-interpolated strings escaped under :escape_html
     I think we can just wrap interpolated code with (),
     since it's already interpolated.
   Can also use () to wrap contents of _haml_temp so that commas throw errors when not in :ugly
   [2.4] Allow "!!! HTML5" to set :format => :html5 ?
     How do we deal with partials?
   [2.4] :ugly + :html improvements
     Ignore closing tags where we can

       Requires Haml parsing refactor
     Don't quote attributes that don't require it

** Sass
   [2.4] CSS superset
   [2.4] Classes are mixins
     Can refer to specific property values? Syntax?
   [2.4] Pre-parse everything possible: never call Node#interpolate
   [2.4] Do all parsing in to_tree
   [2.4] Pull in Compass watcher stuff
   [2.4] Internationalization
     Particularly word constituents in Regexps
   [2.4] Optimization
     http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/
     Also comma-folding identical rules where possible
     Multiple levels
       0: No optimization
       1: Nothing that changes doc structure
         No comma-folding
       2: Anything that keeps functionality identical to O2 (default)
       3: Assume order of rules doesn't matter
       Comma-fold even if there are intervening rules that might interfere
