;;; haml-mode.el -- Major mode for editing Haml files
;;; Written by Nathan Weizenbaum

;;; Because Haml's indentation schema is similar
;;; to that of YAML and Python, many indentation-related
;;; functions are similar to those in yaml-mode and python-mode.

;;; To install, save this somewhere and add the following to your .emacs file:
;;;
;;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/haml-mode.el")
;;; (require 'haml-mode nil 't)
;;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.haml$" . haml-mode))
;;;
