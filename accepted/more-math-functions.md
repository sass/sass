## Background

> This section is non-normative.

Sass recently implemented a module system with a new built-in `sass:math`
module. The demand for built-in math functions can now be fulfilled safely by
implementing them inside this module. None of these new functions will be made
available on the global namespace.

## Summary

> This section is non-normative.

This proposal defines Sassified versions of all the mathematical functions in
the [CSS Values and Units 4 Draft][], as well as logarithms and the constants
`e` and `pi`. Each function is basically equivalent to its mathematical form,
with stricter unit handling. Proper unit handling prevents these functions from
creating meaningless units. For instance, consider `(1px)^(1/3)`—what does
the unit `px^(1/3)` mean?

[CSS Values and Units 4 Draft]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#math

To avoid issues like this, the exponential functions—`log()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`—
accept only a unitless number as input, and output a unitless number.

The trig functions—`cos()`, `sin()`, `tan()`—accept a SassScript number with a
unit, as long as that unit is an [angle][] type. If the input is a unitless
number, it is treated as though it were in `rad`. These functions output a
unitless number.

[angle]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#angles

The inverse trig functions—`acos()`, `asin()`, `atan()`—accept a unitless number
and output a SassScript number in `deg`. `atan2()` is similar, but it accepts
two unitless numbers.

`clamp()` accepts three SassScript numbers with [compatible][] units: the
minimum value, preferred value, and maximum value. This function "clamps" the
preferred value in between the minimum and maximum values, while preserving
their units appropriately. For example, `clamp(1in, 15cm, 12in)` outputs `15cm`,
whereas `clamp(1in, 1cm, 12in)` outputs `1in`.

[compatible]: ../spec/built-in-modules/math.md#compatible

`hypot()` accepts `n` SassScript numbers with compatible units, and outputs the
length of the `n`-dimensional vector that has components equal to each of the
inputs. Since the inputs' units may all be different, the output takes the unit
of the first input.

## Semantics

### Built-in Module Variables

Variables defined in built-in modules are not modifiable. As such, this proposal
modifies the semantics of [Executing a Variable Declaration][] within the
[Variables spec][] to read as follows:

[Executing a Variable Declaration]: ../spec/variables.md#executing-a-variable-declaration
[Variables spec]: ../spec/variables.md

To execute a `VariableDeclaration` `declaration`:

* Let `value` be the result of evaluating `declaration`'s `Expression`.

* Let `name` be `declaration`'s `Variable`.

* **Let `resolved` be the result of [resolving a variable][] named `name`.**

[resolving a variable]: ../spec/modules.md#resolving-a-member

* If `name` is a `NamespacedVariable` and `declaration` has a `!global` flag,
  throw an error.

* **Otherwise, if `resolved` is a variable from a built-in module, throw an
  error.**

* Otherwise, if `declaration` is outside of any block of statements, *or*
  `declaration` has a `!global` flag, *or* `name` is a `NamespacedVariable`:

  * ~~Let `resolved` be the result of [resolving a variable][] named `name` using
    `file`, `uses`, and `import`.~~

  (...)

* Otherwise, if `declaration` is within one or more blocks associated with
  `@if`, `@each`, `@for`, and/or `@while` rules *and no other blocks*:

  * ~~Let `resolved` be the result of [resolving a variable][] named `name`.~~

  (...)

* ~~Otherwise, if no block containing `declaration` has a [scope][] with a
  variable named `name`, set the innermost block's scope's variable `name` to
  `value`.~~

[scope]: ../spec/variables.md#scope

* **Otherwise, if `resolved` is null, get the innermost block containing
  `declaration` and set its scope's variable `name` to `value`.**

* ~~Otherwise, let `scope` be the scope of the innermost block such that `scope`
  already has a variable named `name`.~~

* **Otherwise, set `resolved`'s value to `value`.**

## Variables

### `$e`

Equal to the value of the mathematical constant `e` with a precision of 10
digits after the decimal point: `2.7182818285`.

### `$pi`

Equal to the value of the mathematical constant `pi` with a precision of 10
digits after the decimal point: `3.1415926536`.

## Functions

### `clamp()`

```

#### `atan2()`

> `atan2($y, $x)` is distinct from `atan($y / $x)` because it preserves the
> quadrant of the point in question. For example, `atan2(1, -1)` corresponds to

> `atan(-1 / 1)` resolve first to `atan(-1)`, so both return `-45deg`.
