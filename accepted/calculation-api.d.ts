/**
 * # JavaScript Calculation API: Draft 2
 *
 * *([Issue](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/818),
 * [Changelog](calculation-api.changes.md))*
 *
 * ## Background
 *
 * > This section is non-normative.
 *
 * This proposal simply exposes the [calculation type] to the JavaScript API.
 *
 * [calculation type]: ../accepted/first-class-calc.md
 *
 * ## Summary
 *
 * > This section is non-normative.
 *
 * ### Design Decisions
 *
 * #### Simplification
 *
 * We considered eagerly simplifying calculations as they were constructed to
 * match the behavior of values in Sass itself. However, this poses a problem
 * for API implementations that don't have direct access to compiler logic, such
 * as the Node.js embedded host: they would need to implement the simplification
 * logic locally, which is relatively complex and opens a broad surface area for
 * subtle cross-implementation incompatibilities.
 *
 * This could potentially be solved by adding an explicit request to the
 * embedded protocol, but this would pose its own problems given that JS is
 * strict about separating asynchronous calls (like those across process
 * boundaries) and synchronous calls (like this API).
 *
 * Given that, we chose instead to handle simplification only at the custom
 * function boundary rather than when a calculation is constructed.

     *     [<ident-token>]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax-3/#ident-token-diagram
     *
     *   - Let `name` be `signature`'s <ident-token>.
     *
     *   - If there's already a global function whose name is
     *     underscore-insensitively equal to `name`, continue to the next
     *     key/value pair.
     *
     *   - Otherwise, add a global function whose signature is `signature`. When
     *     this function is called:
     *
     *     - Let `result` be the result of calling the associated
     *       `CustomFunction` with the given arguments. If this call throws an
     *       error, treat it as a Sass error thrown by the Sass function.
     *
     *       > As in the rest of Sass, `_`s and `-`s are considered equivalent
     *       > when determining which function signatures match.
     *
     *     - Throw an error if `result` is or transitively contains:
     *
     *       - An object that's not an instance of the `Value` class.
     *
     *       - A `SassFunction` whose `signature` field isn't a valid Sass
     *         function signature that could appear after the `@function`
     *         directive in a Sass stylesheet.
     *
     *     - Return a copy of `result.internal` with all calculations it
     *       transitively contains (including the return value itself if it's a
     *       calculation) replaced with the result of [simplifying] those
     *       calculations.
