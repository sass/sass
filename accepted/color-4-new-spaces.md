## Background

> This section is non-normative.

Historically, CSS has only provided authors with color formats using the RGB
model, limited to the sRGB gamut. As CSS is used for more applications (such as
print) and displays continue to improve, those limitations become more clear.
The [CSS Color Level 4][color-4] specification defines a number of new color
spaces, each with its own syntax, representing both new color models and
wider RGB gamuts.

* A *color model* is a mathematical approach to representing colors and their
  relationships. Historically, RGB has been the dominant color model for both
  computer monitors and web browsers. Lately, CIELab and Oklab models have
  shown significant benefits by providing a more *perceptually uniform*
  distribution of colors, so that similar mathematical adjustments achieve
  visually similar results.

* A *color space* is the result of projecting a color model into a coordinate
  system. In CSS, each color syntax describes a specific (and often unique)
  color space. For example, `rgb()`, `color(srgb)`, and `color(display-p3)` all
  project the RGB color model into cubic coordinate systems, while `hsl()`
  projects the same color model into a cylindrical (polar-angle) space.
  Similarly, `oklab()` and `oklch()` provide different coordinate projections
  of the Oklab model.

* A *color gamut* is the full range of colors that can be described in a color
  space. Historically, all CSS syntaxes have been limited to the sRGB gamut.
  However, modern computer monitors often support wider gamuts. Color spaces
  like `srgb` and `display-p3` describe different gamuts of color, using the
  same underlying RGB color model, and differently-mapped cubic coordinates.

These terms can get a bit confusing, since there is so much overlap. The term
"RGB" can refer to a color model, a color space, a coordinate system, and also
a color function. The "RGB" color space is identical to the "sRGB" space, and
both describe the "sRGB" gamut. But we have both `rgb()` and `color(srgb)`
syntax, in order to distinguish legacy from non-legacy variations. They also
have different coordinate systems: `rgb()` accepts a range from 0-255, while
`color(srgb)` accept values from 0-1.

The result is that authors can generally think of each color syntax as a unique
space, and each space implies an associated gamut and coordinate system. Color
spaces become a simple way to refer to all parts combined. We've used that same
approach in Sass, so that the name of a color space can be used to reference the
associated gamut. For example, `color.to-gamut($color, hsl, $method:
local-minde)` and `color.to-gamut($color, srgb, $method: local-minde)` have the
same meaning, both mapping a color into the sRGB gamut.

Since all CSS colors up until this point have been restricted to RGB math in
the sRGB gamut, Sass has historically treated all color formats and spaces as
interchangeable. That has allowed authors to inspect and manipulate colors in
any space, without careful management or gamut mapping. It has also allowed
Sass to output the most browser-compatible CSS format for any given color.

In order to support the color spaces in CSS, Sass will need to start tracking
the space/gamut associated with any given color, and provide author tools for
managing those color spaces/gamuts. In addition to supporting the new color
space functions like `color()` and `lab()`, we will update all functions in the
color module to support multiple spaces, and provide some additional space and
gamut management and inspection functions.

## Summary

> This section is non-normative.

This proposal defines a Sass representation of colors with color spaces,
Sassified versions of all the color functions in [CSS Color Level 4][color-4],
updated definitions of existing Sass functions to accommodate color spaces, as
well as several new Sass-specific color functions.

### Rules of Thumb

There are several rules of thumb for working with color spaces in Sass:

* The `rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb` spaces are considered "legacy spaces", and will
  often get special handling for the sake of backwards compatibility. Colors
  defined using hex notation or CSS color names are considered part of the `rgb`
  color space. Legacy colors are emitted in the most compatible format. This
  matches CSS's own backwards-compatibility behavior.

* Otherwise, any color defined in a given space will remain in that space, and
  be emitted in that space.

* Authors can explicitly convert a color's space by using `color.to-space()`.
  This can be useful to enforce non-legacy behavior, by converting into a
  non-legacy space; or to ensure the color output is compatible with older
  browsers by converting colors into a legacy space before emitting.

* The `srgb` color space is equivalent to `rgb`, except that one is a legacy
  space, and the other is not. They also use different coordinate systems, with
  `rgb()` accepting a range from 0-255, and `srgb` using a range of 0-1.

* Color functions that allow specifying a color space for manipulation will
  always use the source color space by default. When an explicit space is
  provided for manipulation, the resulting color will still be returned in the
  same space as the origin color. For `color.mix()`, the first color parameter
  is considered the origin color.

* All legacy and RGB-style spaces represent bounded gamuts of color. Since
  mapping colors into gamut is a lossy process, it should generally be left to
  browsers, which can map colors as-needed, based on the capabilities of a
  display. For that reason, out-of-gamut channel values are always maintained by
  Sass, even when converting into gamut-bounded color spaces. Authors can also
  perform explicit gamut mapping with the `color.to-gamut()` function.

* Legacy browsers require colors in the `srgb` gamut. However, most modern
  displays support the wider `display-p3` gamut.

### Standard CSS Color Functions

#### `oklab()` and `oklch()`

The `oklab()` (cubic) and `oklch()` (cylindrical) functions provide access to an
unbounded gamut of colors in a perceptually uniform space. Authors can use these
functions to define reliably uniform colors. For example, the following colors
are perceptually similar in lightness and saturation:

```scss
$pink: oklch(64% 0.196 353deg); // hsl(329.8 70.29% 58.75%)
$blue: oklch(64% 0.196 253deg); // hsl(207.4 99.22% 50.69%)
```

The `oklch()` format uses consistent "lightness" and "chroma" values, while the
`hsl()` format shows dramatic changes in both "lightness" and "saturation". As
such, `oklch` is often the best space for consistent transformations.

#### `lab()` and `lch()`

The `lab()` and `lch()` functions provide access to an unbounded gamut of colors
in a space that's less perpetually-uniform but more widely-adopted than Oklab
and Oklch.

#### `hwb()`

Sass now supports a top-level `hwb()` function that uses the same syntax as
CSS's built-in `hwb()` function.

#### `color()`

The new `color()` function provides access to a number of specialty spaces. Most
notably, `display-p3` is a common space for wide-gamut monitors, making it
likely to be a popular option for authors who simply want access to a wider
range of colors. For example, P3 greens are significantly "brighter" and more
saturated than the greens available in sRGB:

```scss
$fallback-green: rgb(0% 100% 0%);
$brighter-green: color(display-p3 0 1 0);
```

Sass will natively support all predefined color spaces declared in the Colors
Level 4 specification.

### New Sass Color Functions

#### `color.channel()`

This function returns the value of a single channel in a color. By default, it
only supports channels that are available in the color's own space, but you can
pass the `$space` parameter to return the value of the channel after converting
to the given space.

```scss
$brand: hsl(0 100% 25.1%);

// result: 25.1%
$hsl-lightness: color.channel($brand, "lightness");

// result: 37.67%
$oklch-lightness: color.channel($brand, "lightness", $space: oklch);
```

#### `color.is-missing()`

This function returns whether a given channel value is "missing" (set to
`none`). This is necessary, since `color.channel` returns `0` for missing
channels. Since color-space conversion can change which channels are missing,
this function only supports inspecting channels that are part of the color's own
space.

```scss
$brand: hsl(none 100% 25.1%);

// result: false
$missing-lightness: color.is-missing($brand, "lightness");

// result: true
$missing-hue: color.is-missing($brand, "hue");
```

#### `color.space()`

This function returns the name of the color's space.

```scss
// result: hsl
$hsl-space: color.space(hsl(0 100% 25.1%));

// result: oklch
$oklch-space: color.space(oklch(37.7% 38.75% 29.23deg));
```

#### `color.is-in-gamut()`, `color.is-legacy()`

These functions return various facts about the color. `color.is-in-gamut()`
returns whether the color is in-gamut for its color space (as opposed to having
one or more of its channels out of bounds, like `color(display-pr 1.2 0 0)`).
`color.is-legacy()` returns whether the color is a legacy color in the `rgb`,
`hsl`, or `hwb` color space.

#### `color.to-gamut()`

This function returns a color that is in the given gamut, using the given
mapping algorithm to convert out-of-gamut colors into the desired gamut with as
little perceptual change as possible. The current recommended algorithm is
`local-minde`, which is defined in the current candidate recommendation of CSS
Color 4, and which will usually be more reliable for generating fallback values
than the "channel clipping" approach used by current browsers.

```scss
$green: oklch(0.8 2 150);

// oklch(0.91 0.14 164)
$rgb: color.to-gamut($green, "srgb", $method: local-minde);

// oklch(0.91 0.16 163)
$p3: color.to-gamut($green, "display-p3", $method: local-minde);
```

#### `color.is-powerless()`

This function returns whether a given channel is "powerless" in the given color.
This is a special state that's defined for individual color spaces, which
indicates that a channel's value won't affect how a color is displayed.

```scss
$grey: hsl(0 0% 60%);

// result: true, because saturation is 0
$hue-powerless: color.is-powerless($grey, "hue");

// result: false
$lightness-powerless: color.is-powerless($grey, "lightness");
```

#### `color.same()`

This function returns whether two colors will be displayed the same way, even if
this requires converting between spaces. This is unlike the `==` operator, which
always considers colors in different non-legacy spaces to be unequal.

```scss
$orange-rgb: #ff5f00;
$orange-oklch: color.to-space($orange-rgb, oklch);

// result: false
$equal: $orange-rgb == $orange-oklch;

// result: true
$same: color.same($orange-rgb, $orange-oklch);
```

### Existing Sass Color Functions

#### `color.scale()`, `color.adjust()`, and `color.change()`

By default, all Sass color transformations are handled and returned in the color
space of the original color parameter. However, all relevant functions now allow
specifying an explicit color space for transformations. For example, lightness &
darkness adjustments are most reliable in `oklch`:

```scss
$brand: hsl(0 100% 25.1%);

// result: hsl(0 100% 43.8%)
$hsl-lightness: color.scale($brand, $lightness: 25%);

// result: hsl(5.76 56% 45.4%)
$oklch-lightness: color.scale($brand, $lightness: 25%, $space: oklch);
```

Note that the returned color is still emitted in the original color space, even
when the adjustment is performed in a different space.

#### `color.mix()`

The `color.mix()` function will retain its existing behavior for legacy color
spaces, but for new color spaces it will match CSS's "color interpolation"
specification. This is how CSS computes which color to use in between two colors
in a gradient or an animation.

#### Deprecations

A number of existing functions only make sense for legacy colors, and so are
being deprecated in favor of color-space-friendly functions like
`color.channel()` and `color.adjust()`:

* `color.red()`
* `color.green()`
* `color.blue()`
* `color.hue()`
* `color.saturation()`
* `color.lightness()`
* `color.whiteness()`
* `color.blackness()`
* `color.alpha()`
* `adjust-hue()`
* `saturate()`
* `desaturate()`
* `transparentize()`/`fade-out()`
* `opacify()`/`fade-in()`
* `lighten()`/`darken()`

### Design Decisions

#### Unclamped Channels

Most of the design decisions involved in the proposal are based on the [CSS
Color Level 4][color-4] specification, which we have tried to emulate as closely
as possible while maintaining support for legacy projects. In some cases, that
required major changes to the way Sass handles colors:

1. Channel values are no longer internally clamped to the gamut of a color
   space. By default Sass will output CSS with out-of-gamut colors, because
   these colors are handled differently when doing interpolation across
   different color spaces. Browsers may also eventually handle gamut-mapping for
   these colors, although at the time of writing they do not. Authors can also
   use the provided `color.to-gamut()` function to force a color to be mapped
   into the gamut of its native color space.

2. RGB-style channel values are no longer rounded to the nearest integer, since
   the spec now requires maintaining precision wherever possible. This is
   especially important in RGB spaces, where color distribution is inconsistent.

#### Clamped Channels

Per the CSS specs, certain channels are clamped at parse time [but *not* in
interpolation] for specific color functions:

[but *not* in interpolation]: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9484

* All channels of the `rgb()` function.
* The lower bound of the saturation channel of the `hsl()` function.
* The lightness channel of the `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, and `oklch()`
  functions.
* The lower bound of the chroma channel of the `lch()` and `oklch()` functions.

However, it's necessary to use out-of-gamut values in these spaces to represent
valid colors from other spaces—for example, `color(xyz 1 1 1)` is equivalent to
`lab(100.12% 9.0645 5.8018)` and `color(prophoto-rgb 0 1 0)` is equivalent to
`rgb(-221.6192400378, 279.4082218845, -109.1140773956)`. To match the behavior
of CSS, we have to clamp these channels when constructing colors directly
through color functions, so writing `lab(110% 0 0)` will return `lab(100% 0 0)`.
On the other hand, to preserve colors on a round trip between spaces, we need to
allow the internal representation of these colors to go out-of-gamut.

The question remains as to how to handle cases that don't directly correspond to
CSS, such as the `color.change()` function. Because out-of-gamut clamped
channels are meaningful in CSS, we've chosen the design principle of preserving
them in all situations where clamping isn't specifically mandated by CSS, or in
the `color.adjust()` function to preserve historical behavior.

In addition, to ensure that that the colors represent the same values in CSS
that they do in Sass, they'll be serialized to special formats that preserves
their out-of-gamut values:

* Out-of-gamut RGB colors are serialized to `hsl()`, the lightness channel and
  saturation upper bound of which per spec are not clamped at parse-time
  (although in practice browsers do clamp them at time of writing). This ensures
  that older browsers will still handle these colors somewhat correctly while
  preserving the unclamped value for modern browsers (once they're
  standard-compliant).

* Out-of-gamut Lab, LCH, OKLab, and OKLCH colors are serialized to `color-mix(in
  ..., color(xyz ...) 100%, black)` to preserve both the original color space
  and the unclamped value in conformant browsers.

The Sass specification is intentionally flexible to allow these output formats
to change over time in response to evolving specification and browser behaviors.

#### Conventions for Channels and Space Names

This proposal uses different conventions for referring to the names of color
spaces as it does for referring to the names of individual channels within those
spaces. Specifically:

* Color space names are required to be unquoted and matched case-insensitively.

* Color channels are required to be matched case-sensitively, and to be quoted
  unless they're used as keyword arguments.

This is motivated by the fact that color space names are a CSS-native construct
which are used in the `color()` and `color-mix()` functions, and in those
contexts are unquoted and case-insensitive; while the channel names, although
*informed* by CSS's color space definitions, are ultimately Sass-specific and
follow the more common Sass API conventions. Even when CSS does refer to
channels, such as in the [relative color syntax] of CSS Color 5, it universally
refers to them as single characters rather than full names. We wish to avoid
these single-character names both for readability and for
backwards-compatibility with older Sass APIs.

[relative color syntax]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#relative-colors

In addition, requiring that channel names be quoted avoids the issue where
unquoted `red`, `green`, and `blue` channels of many colors would be parsed by
Sass as color values rather than unquoted strings.

#### Changing Color Spaces

Different color spaces often represent different color-gamuts, which can present
a new set of problems for authors. Some color manipulations are best handled
in a wide-gamut space like `oklch`, but (for now) authors will likely prefer
emitting legacy colors that work in existing and legacy browsers. While that
is likely to change in the long term, we think it's a worthwhile tradeoff to
prioritize author control and legacy color use-cases. Authors who do choose to
emit non-legacy colors are less likely to be working in legacy color spaces to
begin with. So we've established the following guidelines for color conversion
and mapping in Sass color functions:

* Every color function returns a color in the same space as the original color,
  no matter what space was used for transformations. The only exception is
  `color.to-space()`, which is used for explicit space conversion. Functions
  that accept two colors (such as `color.mix()`) return a color in the same
  space as the first color argument.

* No color function performs gamut-mapping on out-of-gamut channels except
  `color.to-gamut()`, which is used for explicit gamut-mapping.

#### Gamut Mapping

Browsers currently use channel-clipping rather than the proposed [css gamut
mapping algorithm][css-mapping] to handle colors that cannot be shown correctly
on a given display. Moreover, there is still active discussion among the CSS
working group and browser vendors about what the best gamut mapping algorithm
is, with the currently-specified algorithm widely considered to be sub-optimal.
As such, we want to avoid baking it in as the default for Sass such that any
change would require a deprecation period followed by a breaking change.

At the same time, we expect gamut-mapping to be very useful for Sass authors
working with wide-gamut color spaces, enough so that we want it to be available
without needing to wait on the CSSWG to come to a consensus on the best
algorithm. To that end, we've decided to provide `color.to-gamut()` but
*require* a `$method` argument for forwards-compatibility with better gamut
mapping algorithms.

Initially, there will only be two available arguments for `$method`:
`local-minde`, the gamut mapping algorithm specified in Color 4 at the time this
spec is written, and `clip` which will just clip any channel values that are
out-of-range for a given color space. However, we expect to expand this to
additional algorithms in the future, and to eventually make it optional and have
its default match the behavior of CSS.

#### CSS Color 5

We are not attempting to support all of [CSS Color Level 5][color-5] at this
point, since it is not yet implemented in browsers. However, we have used it as
a reference while updating color manipulation functions such as `color.mix()`.

There is also an [open issue in CSS] to determine how the [relative color syntax]
from Level 5 should handle [missing] color components. Since the relative color
syntax provides similar functionality to the Sass `color.adjust()` and
`color.scale()` functions, we have decided to wait and match the CSS behavior
once it is specified. In the meantime, Sass will throw errors when trying to
adjust or scale a missing component. This is not the ideal behavior, but it
provides us with the most flexibility to change our behavior in the future.

#### Special Thanks

Thanks to the editors of the CSS Color Level 4 specification (Tab Atkins Jr.,
Chris Lilley, and Lea Verou) for answering our many questions along the way. We
also used Chris and Lea's [Color.js](https://colorjs.io/) library as a
reference as we developed this proposal.

## Definitions

### Color

> Note that channel values are stored as specified, maintaining precision where
> possible, even when the values are out-of-gamut for the [known color space].

A *color* is an object with several parts:

* A *color space* that is a [known color space].

* An ordered list of *channel*s, each one containing a [double] or the special
  value `none`.

* An *alpha* that is either the special value `none` or a [double] between
  `0-1` (inclusive).

  > While it's valid to specify numbers outside this range, they are
  > meaningless, and can be clamped by input functions when generating a color.

[known color space]: #known-color-space
[double]: ../spec/types/number.md#double

### Legacy Color

[legacy color]: #legacy-color
[legacy colors]: #legacy-color

> Both Sass and CSS have similar legacy behavior that relies on all colors
> being interchangeable as part of a shared `srgb` color space. While the new
> color spaces will opt users into new default behavior, some legacy color
> spaces behave differently for the sake of backwards-compatibility.

Colors in the `rgb`, `hsl`, or `hwb` [color spaces](#known-color-space) are
considered *legacy colors*. The output of a legacy color is not required to
match the input color space, and several color functions maintain legacy
behavior when manipulating legacy colors.

Legacy colors that have [missing] components are
[serialized as non-legacy colors](#serialization-of-non-legacy-colors).

> This includes colors defined using the CSS color names, hex syntax, `rgb()`,
> `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, or `hwb()` -- along with colors that are
> manually converted into legacy color spaces.

### Color Equality

For determining *equality* between two colors `color1` and `color2`:

* If both colors are [legacy colors] in different spaces, return
  `color.to-space(color1, rgb) == color.to-space(color2, rgb)`.

* If the colors are not in the same color space, return false.

* If either color has a channel (including alpha) marked as [missing] that the
  other does not, return false.

* Return whether each matching pair of non-missing channel values (including
  alpha) is fuzzy-equal.

  > Since this definition no longer involves rounding channels for the legacy
  > RGB space, it is potentially a breaking change. Moving forward, `rgb(0 0
  > 0.6) != rgb(0 0 1)`.

### Known Color Space

Each known color space has a name and an ordered list of associated channels.
Each channel has a name, and an optional associated unit. Color space names are
matched case-insensitively and referred to using unquoted strings, and are
always emitted as unquoted lowercase strings by inspection functions. Color
channel names are matched case-sensitively and referred to using quoted strings.

Values outside a *bounded gamut* range (including infinity or negative infinity)
are valid but are considered *out of gamut* for the given color space. They
remain un-clamped unless the gamut is specifically marked as "clamped", in which
case they're clamped *only* when constructing the color from its global
constructor function or `color.adjust()`.

Some color spaces include a *polar angle* channel (so far exclusively called
`hue`). Polar-angle hues represent an angle position around a given hue wheel,
using a CSS `<angle>` dimension or number (interpreted as a `deg` value when no
units are passed), and are serialized with `deg` units. Polar angle channels are
normalized using modulo to fall within their conventional range. Any channel
that is not polar-angle is considered *scalable*.

All channels have a conventional range of values, whose bounds are referred to
as the channel's *lower bound* and *upper bound* (although for unbounded
channels these bounds aren't enforced anywhere). For scalable channels,
percentages provided by the user are converted to match these bounds. `0%`
always refers to the value 0, `100%` always refers to the upper bound of the
range, and `-100%` always refers to the negative value of the upper bound of the
range. (In many cases this is considered outside the conventional scope of the
color space, but the `a` and `b` channels do conventionally cover negative
values as well.)

Colors specified using a CSS color keyword or the hex notation are treated as
`rgb` colors.

The known color spaces and their channels are:

* `rgb` (RGB, legacy):
  * `red`, `green`, `blue`:
    * gamut: bounded, clamped
    * range: `[0,255]`

      > Percentages `[0%,100%]` map to the `[0,255]` range.

* `hwb` (RGB, legacy):
  * `hue` (polar angle):
    * associated unit: `deg`
    * range: `[0,360]`
  * `whiteness`, `blackness`:
    * associated unit: `%`
    * gamut: bounded
    * range: `[0,100]`

* `hsl` (RGB, legacy):
  * `hue` (polar angle):
    * associated unit: `deg`
    * range: `[0,360]`
  * `saturation`:
    * gamut: bounded, clamped (lower bound only)
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,100]`
  * `lightness`:
    * gamut: bounded
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,100]`

* `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`, `prophoto-rgb`,
  `rec2020` (RGB):
  * `red`, `green`, `blue`:
    * gamut: bounded
    * range: `[0,1]`

* `xyz`, `xyz-d50`, `xyz-d65`:
  * `x`, `y`, `z`:
    * gamut: un-bounded
    * range: `[0,1]`

* `lab`:
  * `lightness`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,100]`

  * `a`, `b`:
    * gamut: un-bounded
    * range: `[-125,125]`

* `lch`:
  * `lightness`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,100]`

  * `chroma`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped (lower bound only)
    * range: `[0,150]`

  * `hue` (polar angle):
    * associated unit: `deg`
    * range: `[0,360]`

* `oklab`:
  * `lightness`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,1]`

  * `a`, `b`:
    * gamut: un-bounded
    * range: `[-0.4,0.4]`

* `oklch`:
  * `lightness`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped
    * associated unit: `%`
    * range: `[0,1]`

  * `chroma`:
    * gamut: un-bounded, clamped (lower bound only)
    * range: `[0,0.4]`

  * `hue` (polar angle):
    * associated unit: `deg`
    * range: `[0,360]`

If a color with negative saturation or chroma would be created in the `hsl`,
`lch`, or `oklch` spaces by any means, instead create a color with the absolute
value of that saturation or chroma and the hue rotated by 180deg.

> This is an equivalent color, and in fact passing channels with negative
> saturation/chroma through conversion to other color spaces and back will
> produce this same result. This helps ensure that identical colors are
> represented uniformly.
>
> Note that this conversion happens *after* any clipping, so `hsl(0deg -50%
> 50%)` returns `hsl(0deg 0% 50%)`, not `hsl(180deg 50% 50%)`.

The `xyz-d65` space is an alias for `xyz`, and implementations should report the
space name as `xyz` even if it was originally written as `xyz-d65`.

### Predefined Color Spaces

> "Predefined color spaces" can be described using the `color()` function.

The *predefined RGB spaces* are:

* `srgb`
* `srgb-linear`
* `display-p3`
* `a98-rgb`
* `prophoto-rgb`
* `rec2020`

The *predefined XYZ spaces* are:

* `xyz`
* `xyz-d50`
* `xyz-d65` (an alias for `xyz`)

### Missing Components

In some cases, a color can have one or more missing components (channel or alpha
values). Unless explicitly specified otherwise, missing components are treated
as though they had the value `0`.

> Some situations where missing components are treated specially include
> interpolation, the `==` operator, and color space conversion.

For the sake of [interpolating] between colors with missing components, the
following *analogous components* are defined by [CSS Color Level 4][color-4]:

| Category      | Components          |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Reds          | red, x              |
| Greens        | green, y            |
| Blues         | blue, z             |
| Lightness     | lightness           |
| Colorfulness  | chroma, saturation  |
| Hue           | hue                 |

[interpolating]: #interpolating-colors

### Powerless Components

In some color spaces, it is possible for a channel value to be considered
*powerless* in certain circumstances.

* `hsl`:

  * If the `saturation` value is `0%`, then the `hue` channel is powerless.

* `hwb`:

  * If `whiteness + blackness` is greater than or equal to `100%`, then the
    `hue` channel is powerless.

* `lch`/`oklch`:

  * If the `chroma` value is 0%, then the `hue` channel is powerless.

> In some circumstances, conversion between color spaces will mark powerless
> components in the output as missing.

### Color Interpolation Method

A *color interpolation method* is a space-separated list of unquoted strings,
parsed according to the following syntax definition:

<x><pre>
**ColorInterpolationMethod** ::= RectangularColorSpace
&#32;                          | (PolarColorSpace HueInterpolationMethod?)
**HueInterpolationMethod**   ::= (
&#32;                                'shorter'
&#32;                              | 'longer'
&#32;                              | 'increasing'
&#32;                              | 'decreasing'
&#32;                            ) 'hue'
</pre></x>

A valid *PolarColorSpace* is the name of a [known color space] with a polar
angle hue channel. A *RectangularColorSpace* is the name of any other
[known color space], without a polar-angle hue. The *interpolation color space*
is the result of [looking up a known color space] named by either the
`PolarColorSpace` or `RectangularColorSpace` productions.

`ColorInterpolationMethod` is case-insensitive.

> Different color interpolation methods provide different advantages. For that
> reason, individual color procedures and functions can establish their own
> color interpolation defaults, or provide a syntax for authors to explicitly
> choose the method that best fits their need. The [CSS Color Level 4][color-4]
> specification provides [additional guidance][default-space] for determining
> appropriate defaults.

## Serialization

### Serialization of Non-Legacy Colors

To serialize a non-legacy color `color`:

* If `color` has a clamped channel whose value is out-of-bounds, emit a CSS
  [`<color>`] expression that evaluates to `color`'s value, then return.

  > The specific syntax here is left up to implementations, based on the
  > specifics of the color in question and the realities of browser support.
  > Two options include:
  >
  > * `color-mix()`. For example, `color-mix(in lab, color(xyz 1 1 1) 100%,
  >   black)` will losslessly convert `color(xyz 1 1 1)` into `lab` where the
  >   native `lab` syntax would clamp the lightness at `100%`.
  >
  > * [Relative color syntax], which per spec is never clamped. For example,
  >   while the lightness in `lab(200 50 50)` is clamped, the lightness in
  >   `lab(from black 200 50 50)` is not.
  >
  > At the time of writing, browser support is patchy for these syntaxes and no
  > browser correctly avoids clipping in all the cases we're relying on.
  > Although we have no way of ensuring that all color values representable in
  > Sass can be correctly loaded by browsers, this spec aims to ensure that Sass
  > generates the correct value according to the CSS spec and that
  > implementations have enough flexibility within that to target the shifting
  > landscape of what browsers actually support.

* Let `components` be an empty string.

* For each `channel` in `color`'s channels:

  * If `channel` contains the special value `none`, append the unquoted string
    "none" to `components`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Let `channel-number` be a number with the same value as `channel` and unit
      given by `channel`'s associated unit, if it has one.

    * Append the result of serializing `channel-number` to `components`.

  * If `channel` isn't the last channel, append a space to `components`.

* If `color`'s alpha value isn't `1`, append the unquoted string " / " followed
  by the result of serializing a unitless number whose value is `color`'s alpha
  value to `components`.

* Let `space-name` be `color`'s space name as an unquoted lowercase string.

* If `color`'s space is not a [predefined color space], emit `space-name`
  followed by "(", `components`, and then ")".

  > Since a [predefined color space] is defined as a [known color space] that
  > uses the `color()` syntax, this is a reliable way to get the remaining
  > known color spaces that provide their own function syntax.

* Otherwise, emit "color(", followed by `space-name`, " ", `components`, and
  then ")".

[`<color>`]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#typedef-color
[predefined color space]: #predefined-color-spaces

### Serialization of Out-of-Gamut RGB Colors

To serialize an out-of-gamut color `color` in the `rgb` space:

* Let `hsl` be the result of [converting] `color` into the `hsl` space.

* Return the result of serializing `hsl`.

## Procedures

### Looking Up a Known Color Space

This procedure accepts a `name`, and attempts to look up a [known color space]
with a matching name. It returns the color space named `name`, or throws an
error if `name` is not the name of a known color space.

* If `name` is not an unquoted string, throw an error.

* If `name`'s value is case-insensitively equal to the name of a [known color
  space], return that color space.

* Otherwise, throw an error.

  > In the future, we can add support for custom/unknown spaces by returning
  > `null` when no space is found.

[looking up a known color space]: #looking-up-a-known-color-space

### Converting a Color

Colors can be converted from one [known color space] to another. This procedure
accepts a color `origin-color`, and `target-space` which may be either a [known
color space] or a SassScript value, and returns a color `color` in
`target-space`.

> Since the individual CSS color conversion algorithms don't explicitly handle
> the process of "carrying over" missing values on analogous channels, we have
> to handle that here.

* If `target-space` is a SassScript value, set it to the result of [looking up a
  known color space] named `target-space`.

* If `origin-color`'s space is already `target-space`, return `origin-color`.

  > CSS doesn't perform conversions unless they are required.

* Let `missing` be a list of channel names in `origin-color` that are [missing].

* Let `color` be the result of [css-converting] `origin-color` into
  `target-space`.

* For each `channel` in `missing`:

  * If `target-space` has an [analogous component][missing] to `channel`, set
    the analogous component in `color` to `none`.

* If `target-space` is not a [legacy color] space and any `channel`s of `color`
  are [powerless] and not already [missing], set those channels to the special
  value `none`.

  > Don't introduce missing colors to legacy spaces because if users are
  > converting to legacy spaces they're likely targeting older browsers which
  > will choke on `none`.

* Return `color`.

[missing]: #missing-components
[powerless]: #powerless-components

### CSS-Converting a Color Space

[css-converting]: #css-converting-a-color-space

Algorithms for individual color space conversion are defined in the
[CSS Color Level 4][color-4] specification. [CSS color conversion] takes a
color `origin-color`, and a [known color space] `target-space`, and returns a
color `output-color`.

[CSS color conversion]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#color-conversion

The individual conversion algorithms are:

* [HSL to sRGB](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hsl-to-rgb)

* [sRGB to HSL](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#rgb-to-hsl)

* [HWB to sRGB](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hwb-to-rgb)

* [sRGB to HWB](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#rgb-to-hwb)

* [Lab to LCH, Oklab to Oklch](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#lab-to-lch)

* [LCH to Lab, Oklch to Oklab](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#lch-to-lab)

* [Between predefined RGB spaces](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#predefined-to-predefined)

* [Any RGB to Lab/Oklab](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#predefined-to-lab-oklab)

* [Lab/Oklab to any RGB](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#oklab-lab-to-predefined)

> For additional details, see the [Sample code for color conversions][convert].

[convert]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#color-conversion-code

### Gamut Mapping

> Some [known color space]s describe limited color gamuts. If a color is "out of
> gamut" for a particular space (most often because of conversion from a
> larger-gamut color-space), it can be useful to "map" that color to the nearest
> available "in-gamut" color. Gamut mapping is the process of finding an
> in-gamut color with the least objectionable change in visual appearance, which
> is to some degree inherently contextual and subjective.

Gamut mapping takes a color `origin`, a [known color space] `destination`, and
an unquoted string `method`. It returns a color in `origin`'s color space.

* Let `color` be the result of [converting] `origin` into `destination`.

* If `method` is not case-insensitively equal to one of the methods defined
  below, throw an error.

* If `color.is-in-gamut(color)`, return `origin`.

* Let `mapped` be the result of running the method defined below whose name
  matches `method`.

* Return the result of [converting] `mapped` into `origin`'s space.

#### `local-minde`

The `local-minde` gamut mapping procedure in Sass follows the 13 February 2024
draft of CSS Color Module Level 4. It returns the result of [CSS gamut
mapping][css-mapping] `origin` with an origin color space of `origin-space` and
destination of `destination`.

[css-mapping]: https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CRD-css-color-4-20240213/#css-gamut-mapping-algorithm

> This algorithm implements a relative colorimetric intent, and colors inside
> the destination gamut are unchanged.

#### `clip`

The `clip` gamut mapping procedure is not expected to produce good-looking
results, but it can be useful to match the current behavior of browsers.

* Let `new-color` be a copy of `color`.

* For each `channel` in `new-color`'s channels:

  * If `channel` is bounded and not [missing], set its value to the result of
    clamping the original value within `channel`'s minimum and maximum values.

* Return `new-color`.

### Parsing Color Components

This procedure accepts an `input` parameter to parse, along with an optional
[known color space] `space`. It throws common parse errors when necessary, and
returns either a single string of components to emit in a CSS function, or
three values: a color space, a list of channel values, and an alpha value.

> This supports both the space-specific color formats like `hsl()` and `rgb()`,
> where the space is determined by the function, as well as the syntax of
> `color()`, where the space is included as one of the input arguments.

The procedure is:

* If `input` is a [special variable string], return an unquoted string with
  the value of `input`.

* If `input` is a bracketed list, or a list with a separator other than
  slash or space, throw an error.

* If `input` is a slash-separated list:

  * If `input` doesn't have exactly two elements, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, let `components` be the first element and `alpha` the second
    element of `input`.

* Otherwise:

  * Let `components` be an unbracketed space separated list of all except the
    last element of `input`.

  * If the last element of `input` is an unquoted string that contains `/`:

    > This solves for a legacy handling of `/` in Sass that would produce an
    > unquoted string when the alpha value is a CSS function such as `var()`,
    > when either value is `none`, or when using relative color syntax.

    * Let `split-last` be the result calling `string.split()` with the last
      element of `input` as the string to split, and `/` as the separator.

    * If `split-last` doesn't have exactly two items, return an unquoted string
      with the value of `input`.

      > This ensures that `rgb(1 2 calc(var(--a) / var(--b)) / var(--c))` is
      > handled correctly after the final expresssion is fully converted to a
      > string due to legacy `/` behavior.

    * If either item in `split-last` can be parsed as a number, replace the
      current value of the item with the resulting number value.

    * Let `alpha` be the second element in `split-last`, and append the first
      element of `split-last` to `components`.

  * Otherwise, if the last element of `input` has preserved its status as two
    slash-separated numbers:

    * Let `alpha` be the number after the slash, and append the number before
      the slash to `components`.

  * Otherwise, append the last element of `input` to `components`.

* If `components` is an empty list, throw an error.

* If `components` is a [special variable string]:

  * Let `channels` be the value of `components`.

* Otherwise:

  * If `components` is not an unbracketed space-separated list, throw an error.

  * If the first element of `components` is an unquoted string which is
    case-insensitively equal to "from", return an unquoted string with the
    value of `input`.

  * If `space` is null:

    * Let `input-space` be the first element in `components`.

    * If `input-space` is a [special variable string], return an unquoted
      string with the value of `input`.

    * Set `space` be the result of [looking up a known color space] with the
      name `input-space`.

    * If `space` is not a [predefined color space], throw an error.

      > Only predefined spaces can be passed in as color syntax components.
      > All other known color spaces use explicit functions.

    * Let `channels` be an unbracketed space-separated list with the
      remaining elements from `components`.

  * Otherwise, let `channels` be the value of `components`.

  * If any element of `channels` is not either a number, a special variable
    string, a [special number], or an unquoted string that's
    case-insensitively equal to "none", throw an error.

* If `alpha` is null, let `alpha` be `1`.

* Otherwise, If `alpha` is neither a [special number] nor an unquoted string
  that's case-insensitively equal to "none":

  * If `alpha` is not a number, throw an error.

  * Set `alpha` to the result of [percent-converting] `alpha` with a max of 1,
    and then clamping the value between 0 and 1, inclusive.

* If `channels` is a [special variable string], or if `alpha` is a [special
  number], return an unquoted string with the value of `input`.

* If any element of `channels` is a [special number]:

  * If `space` is a [legacy color] space:

    * Let `comma-list` be the result of calling
      `list.append(channels, alpha, "comma")`.

    * Return an unquoted string with the value of `comma-list`.

  * Otherwise, return an unquoted string with the value of `input`.

    > Doing this late in the process allows us to throw any obvious syntax
    > errors, even for colors that can't be fully resolved during compilation.

* If the length of `channels` is not 3, throw an error.

  > Once special values have been handled, any colors remaining should have
  > exactly the expected number of channels.

* Set `channels` to the result of [normalizing] `channels` in `space`.

* Let `space-name` be a lowercase unquoted string of `space`'s name.

* Return `space-name`, `channels` channels, and `alpha` alpha value.

[special variable string]: ../spec/functions.md#special-variable-string
[special number]: ../spec/functions.md#special-number
[percent-converting]: #percent-converting-a-number

### Percent-Converting a Number

This algorithm takes a SassScript number `number` and a number `max`. It returns
a number relative to the range `[0,max]` without clamping.

> In order to support both out-of-gamut channels and unbounded ranges, this
> value is no longer clamped between 0 and `max`

* If `number` has units other than `%`, throw an error.

* Otherwise, if `number` has the unit `%`, return `number * max / 100%`.

* Otherwise, return `number`.

### Validating a Color Channel

[validating]: #validating-a-color-channel

This process accepts a SassScript value `value` to validate, a [known color
space] `space` to validate against, and `channel` a channel in `space`. It
throws an error if the channel is invalid for the color space, or returns a
normalized channel value otherwise.

* If `value` is not a number or an unquoted string that's case-insensitively
  equal to "none", throw an error.

* If `value` is an unquoted string that's case-insensitively equal to "none",
  return `value`.

* Otherwise:

  * If `channel` is a polar angle:

    * Let `angle` be the result of [converting][number-to-unit] `value` to `deg`
      allowing unitless.

    * Return the result of `angle % 360deg`.

  * Let `min` and `max` be the upper and lower bounds of `channel`'s range,
    respectively.

  * Otherwise, set `channel` to the result of [percent-converting] `channel`
    with `min` and `max`.

  * If this was (transitively) invoked from the global [`rgb()`, `lab()`,
    `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, or `color()`] functions and `valid` is a
    clamped channel, return the result of clamping `value` within `min` and
    `max`.

  * Return `value`.

[number-to-unit]: https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/spec/types/number.md#converting-a-number-to-a-unit

### Normalizing Color Channels

[normalizing]: #normalizing-color-channels

This process accepts a list of `values` to validate and a [known color space]
`space` to normalize against. It throws an error if any channel is invalid for
the color space, or returns a normalized list of valid channels otherwise.

* If `values` is not a list, throw an error.

* Let `normal` be an empty list.

* For each `value` at position `i` in `values`:

  * Let `channel` be the channel at position `i` in `space`'s channels.

  * Let `valid` be the result of [validating] `value` as `channel` in `space`.

  * Append `valid` as the next item in `normal`.

* Let `unitless` be an empty list.

* For each `value` in `normal`.

  * If the value of `value` is the special value `none`, append `none` as the
    next item in `unitless`.

  * Otherwise, append the value of `value` as a [double] without units as the
    next item in `unitless`.

* Return `unitless`.

### Interpolating Legacy Colors

> This procedure is based on the legacy behavior of the `color.mix()` function,
> but returns a color in the original `color1` color space.

This procedure accepts two [legacy colors] (`color1` and `color2`), and an
optional percentage `weight` for `color1` in the mix. It returns a new color
`mix` that represents the appropriate mix of input colors.

* Let `origin-space` be `color1`'s color space.

* Let `rgb1` and `rgb2` be the result of [converting] `color1` and `color2`
  respectively into `rgb`.

* If `weight` is null, set `weight-scale` to `0.5`.

* Otherwise, set `weight-scale` to the result of [percent-converting] `weight`
  with a max of 1, and then clamping the value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

* Let `normal-weight` be `weight-scale * 2 - 1`.

* Let `alpha1` and `alpha2` be the alpha values of `rgb1` and `rgb2`

### Interpolating Colors

> This procedure is based on the
> [color interpolation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#interpolation)
> procedures defined in [CSS Color Level 4][color-4].

This procedure accepts two color arguments (`color1` and `color2`), a [color
interpolation method] `method`, and a percentage `weight` for `color1` in the
mix. It returns a new color that represents the appropriate mix of input colors.

* Let `origin-space` be `color1`'s color space.

* If `weight` is null, set `weight` to `0.5`.

* Otherwise, set `weight` to the result of [percent-converting] `weight` with a
  max of 1.

* If `weight > 1` or `weight < 0`, throw an error.

* If `weight == 0`, return the result of [converting] `color2` into
  `origin-space`.

* If `weight == 1`, return `color1`.

* Let `space` be the *interpolation color space* specified by `method`.

* If `space` is a [`PolarColorSpace`][color-method]:

  * Let `hue-arc` be the `HueInterpolationMethod` specified in `method`, or
    `shorter` if no hue interpolation is specified.

* Set `color1` and `color2` respectively to the results of [converting] `color1`
  and `color2` into `space`.

* For each `color` in `color1` and `color2`:

  * If any non-`alpha` component of `color` is [missing], set that its value to
    the value of the corresponding component in the other color unless it's
    missing as well.

  * Set `color` to the result of [premultiplying] `color`.

  * If `color`'s `alpha` component is [missing], set its value to the value of
    the `alpha` component in the other color unless it's missing as well.

    > This is resolved after premultiplying, because premultiplying has special
    > handling for a missing `alpha` component.

* Let `mix` be a new color in the color space `space`, with all channel and
  alpha values initially [missing].

* For each `channel` of `mix`:

  * If the corresponding channels of `color1` and `color2` are missing, continue
    to the next channel.

  * Let `value1` and `value2` be the corresponding channel values in
    `color1` and `color2` respectively.

  * If `channel` has a polar angle value, set `value1` and `value2`
    respectively to the results of [hue interpolation][hue-method] with
    `value1` as `hue1`, `value2` as `hue2`, using the `hue-arc` method.

  * Set `channel` to the result of calculating `(value1 * weight) + (value2 *
    (1 - weight))`.

    > Channel rounding has been removed, since it is a lossy transform.

* Set `mix` the result of [un-premultiplying] `mix`.

* Return the result of [converting] `mix` into `origin-space`.

[premultiplying]: #premultiply-transparent-colors
[un-premultiplying]: #premultiply-transparent-colors
[color-method]: #color-interpolation-method
[hue-method]: #hue-interpolation
[converting]: #converting-a-color

#### Premultiply Transparent Colors

When the colors being interpolated are not fully opaque, they are transformed
into premultiplied color values. This process accepts a single `color` and
updates the channel values if necessary, returning a new color with
premultiplied channels.

* If the `color` has an `alpha` value of 1 or `none`, return `color` unchanged.

  > It's not possible to premultiply channels relative to a missing alpha,
  > and no multiplication is necessary with full opacity.

* Otherwise, for each `channel` in `color`:

  * If the `channel` is not [missing] and `channel` is not a polar angle, set
    `channel`'s value to the result of multiplying `channel`'s value by
    `color`'s `alpha` value.

* Return the resulting `color`.

The same process can be run in reverse, to **un-premultiply** the channels of a
given `color`:

* If `color` has an `alpha` value of 1, 0, or `none`, return `color` unchanged.

* Otherwise, for each `channel` in `color`:

  * If the `channel` is not [missing] and `channel` is a polar angle, set
    `channel`'s value to the result of dividing `channel`'s value by `color`'s
    `alpha` value.

* Return the resulting `color`.

#### Hue Interpolation

> When interpolating between polar-angle channels, there are multiple
> "directions" the interpolation could move, following different logical rules.

This process accepts two angles (`hue1` and `hue2`), and returns both angles
adjusted according to an optional [hue interpolation method] `method`, which
defaults to `shorter`.

[hue interpolation method]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-interpolation

The process for each hue interpolation method is defined in [CSS Color Level
4][color-4] (matched case-insensitively):

* [`shorter`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#shorter)

* [`longer`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-longer)

* [`increasing`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#increasing)

* [`decreasing`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#decreasing)

### Scaling a Number

This algorithm takes a number `number`, a value `factor`, a number `max`, and an
optional number `min` which defaults to 0. It's written "scale `<number>` by
`<factor>` with a `max` of `<max>` and a `min` of `<min>`". It returns a number
with the same units as `number`.

> Note that this no longer assumes the original `number` is in a range of `min`
> to `max`. We now allow scaling up negative numbers, and scaling down numbers
> above the `max` value. The inverse operations return the `number` unchanged,
> since that's the asymptotic scale behavior approaching boundaries.

* If `factor` isn't a number with unit `%` between `-100%` and `100%`
  (inclusive), throw an error.

* If `factor > 0%`:

  * If `number > max`, return `number`.

  * Otherwise, return `number + (max - number) * factor / 100%`.

* Otherwise:

  * If `number < min`, return `number`.

  * Otherwise, return `number + (number - min) * factor / 100%`.

* If `invert()` was called as a global function, `$color` is either a number or
  a [special number], `$weight == 100%`, and `$space` is null, return an
  unquoted string representing a CSS function call with name "invert" and
  argument `$color`.

* If `$color` is not a color, throw an error.

* If `$weight` is neither null nor a number with unit `%`, throw an error.

* If `$space` is null:

  * If `$color` is a [legacy color], let `color` be the result of [converting]
    `$color` to `rgb`.

  * Let `mix-space` be null.

    > This allows us to also enforce legacy behavior in the final weighted mix.

  * Otherwise, throw an error.

* Otherwise:

  * Let `color` be the result of [converting] `$color` to `$space`.

  * Let `mix-space` be the name of `color`'s space.

* If `$weight == 0%`, return `$color`.

* If `color`'s space is `hwb`:

  * Let `white` and `black` be the values of `color`'s channels of those names,
    or the unquoted string "none" if the respective channels are [missing].

  * Let `invert` be the result of calling `color.change(color.complement(color,
    $space: hwb), $white: black, $black: white)`.

* Otherwise:

  * Let `invert` be the value of `color`.

  * For each `channel` in `color`'s channels:

    * Let `value` be `channel`'s value.

    * If `channel` is a polar-angle `hue`:

      * If `channel` is [missing], throw an error.

* Return `color.to-space(result, color.space($color))`.

  > Call `color.to-space()` rather than [converting] `$color` directly so that

  * Let `alpha` be the result of [percent-converting] `alpha` with a max of 1,
    and then clamping the value between 0 and 1, inclusive.

  * Let `hue`, `saturation`, and `lightness` be the three elements returned
